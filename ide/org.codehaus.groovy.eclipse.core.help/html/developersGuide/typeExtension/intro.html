<h1>Adding Support for Dynamic Methods and Properties</h1>
Groovy is a dynamic language - not all properties and methods of an object are defined though declaration in the source
code, but rather may exist only at run time. Different application domains leverage this fact to add new and interesting
methods and properties to classes. The most well known example where the dynamic nature of Groovy is used to its fullest
can be seen in Grails.
<br>
<br>
GroovyEclipse allows plugins to describe these dynamic types. Doing so means that the dynamic members are now visible to
GroovyEclipse and to features such as code completion and type inference.
<br>
<br>
The extension point
<em>org.codehaus.groovy.eclipse.types</em>
is extended to include domain specific types to GroovyEclipse.
