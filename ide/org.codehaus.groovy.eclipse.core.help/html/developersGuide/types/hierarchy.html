<h1>The Type Hiearchy</h1>
The type hiearchy is described, with excerpts of the class fields and methods where appropriate. See the JavaDoc for
details.
<br>
<br>
The classes in the Type hiearchy can be found in package
<em>org.codehaus.groovy.eclipse.core.types<br>
</em>
<br>
package org.codehaus.groovy.eclipse.core.types;
<br>
<h2>Type</h2>
The root of all Type classes.
<p class="Code">public abstract class Type implements Modifiers, Comparable { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final int CLASS = 1; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final int MEMBER = 2; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final int LOCAL_VARIABLE = 3; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final int PARAMETER = 4; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final int FIELD = 5; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final int METHOD = 6; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected String signature; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected String name; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected int modifiers; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private boolean inferred; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public boolean isGroovyType() { ... } <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public boolean isInferred() { ... }<br>
}</p>
The signature is simply the same as that returned by methods in Class. e.g. 'java.lang.String' or '[Ljava.lang.String;'
or '[Z' or 'byte' and so on.
<br>
Other points of interest here are the two methods
<em>isGroovyType()</em>
and
<em>isInferred()</em>
. It it very important that these be implemented in the correct way. Failure to do so can confuse the type evaluator.
<br>
<h3>isGroovyType()</h3>
This method should return false if the type is a Java type. Java types are rarely used. If required they are type names
prefixed with 'Java'.
<h3>isInferred()</h3>
This method should return false if the type is known. This is true for Java types. It is also true in most cases when
extensions are implemented to handle dynamic types.
<br>
<h2>Derived Types</h2>
The derived types act mainly as holders of information relating to their hierarchy. For example,
<em>Member</em>
types have a reference to their declaring class. For details see the JavaDoc.
<h2>Utilities</h2>
Class TypeUtil contains various utilities for creating types amongst other things.
